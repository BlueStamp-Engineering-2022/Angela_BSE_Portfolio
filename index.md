# Facial Recognition Door Lock
A door lock that only opens if it recognizes the guest. It utilizes Raspberry Pi and Arduino in order to process the data, and it uses the data collected from the camera in order to determine if it should open the lock.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was hooking the servo to the Arduino, and making it move. I wired the Arduino to the Raspberry Pi and wrote a quick program to move the servo. I attached the servo to a gear that would be able to slide the door lock open and close. I have attached the wiring chart below

# Starter Project
  

My starter project was a Useless Machine, which, as suggested by the name, does absolutely nothing of use. It's a box with a switch on it, so that when you switch the machine on, an arm comes out and switches it off again. To make it, I first attached the arm to a motor, then I soldered two switches onto the board. I attached the motor with the arm to the board, then hooked both the motor and the board to a battery, and arranged it so when the arm goes up it flips the top switch, and when the arm comes down again it presses on the other switch. Then I place it in the box provided. Since I finished early, I wanted to add an extra part so that it could count the number of times the switch has been flipped. However, it seems like when I was soldering something I may have burned one of the wires, since it didn't work when I attached it to the machine.
