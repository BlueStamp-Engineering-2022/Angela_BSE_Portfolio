# Facial Recognition Door Lock
A door lock that only opens if it recognizes the guest. It utilizes Raspberry Pi and Arduino in order to process the data, and it uses the data collected from the camera in order to determine if it should open the lock.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my tv. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Instead of the Raspberry Pi Os software, I had to first download a different software called Retro Pie. With Retro Pie, I needed to download an Imager for Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software, the one I needed on the Raspberry Pi was Retro Pi. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to set the Operating System to Retro Pi instead of Raspbian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi and rebooted the system and Retro Bi booted up.

# Starter Project
  

My starter project was a Useless Machine, which, as suggested by the name, does absolutely nothing of use. It's a box with a switch on it, so that when you switch the machine on, an arm comes out and switches it off again. To make it, I first attached the arm to a motor, then I soldered two switches onto the board. I attached the motor with the arm to the board, then hooked both the motor and the board to a battery, and arranged it so when the arm goes up it flips the top switch, and when the arm comes down again it presses on the other switch. Then I place it in the box provided. Since I finished early, I wanted to add an extra part so that it could count the number of times the switch has been flipped. However, it seems like when I was soldering something I may have burned one of the wires, since it didn't work when I attached it to the machine.
